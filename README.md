# Multi-AI Agent System

This project demonstrates a multi-agent AI system built using the `phi` library. The system consists of:
1. A **Web Search Agent** that searches the web for information using DuckDuckGo.
2. A **Financial AI Agent** that analyzes stock prices, provides analyst recommendations, and retrieves stock fundamentals using YFinance.
3. A **Multi-AI Agent** that combines both agents to perform complex tasks like retrieving and analyzing financial data.

## Features
- **Web Search Agent**: Uses DuckDuckGo to retrieve information from the web.
- **Financial AI Agent**: Gathers and analyzes financial data.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Combines the capabilities of multiple agents for advanced functionality.
- Outputs formatted responses using Markdown, including tables where applicable.
